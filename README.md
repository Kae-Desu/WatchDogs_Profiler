Hey you're back!\
I bet you got some basic idea about what a profiler is. Then What i'm doing is making that profiler to work in real life but there's so much todo. i use opencv module and python language for this project.

look at this simple draft (proper one will be available in short time).
![Profiler flowchart](/Essentials/flowchart.png)\
for now it should do like this and the faces should be put in /images/[person_name]/[file_name].png or .jpeg both work just fine, and must be trainned with facetrain.py (i only tried to train with 1 photo of my face, maybe i should add more and more haarcascade)

i somehow manage to make the program to recognize my face, but due to bad lightning and some other factor, program maybe worst.
next step and problem is.. to make something like this.\
